# CS405-Secure-Coding

This is a collection of the course material from SNHU CS405 Secure Coding. It reflects the compitancies gained for adopting a Defense in Depth stratagy. Code exampels of preventing buffer overflow, writing exceptions, utalizing encryption, and using google unit tests are included as well as a security policy and presentation for the fictional organization Green Pace. I was unable to upload the entire SQL injection project as it was too large.
